ANDROID APP MANAGER
Dylan Yates


The folder structure included here is for a NetBeans project.

In the dist folder there is a compiled JAR file to run the Android App Manager.

In the src folder there are the source Java files for the project.

In order to use the program you will need the Java Development Kit and the Android SDK.

You will also need an Android keystore file.  I have included the debug keystore in this folder.
	Keystore name: "debug.keystore"
	Keystore password: "android"
	Key alias: "androiddebugkey"
	Key password: "android"
